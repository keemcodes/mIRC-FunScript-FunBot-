# mIRC-FunScript-FunBot-
I made this bot for mIRC using mSL which is a scripting language for mIRC. I created this code back in 2009 when I was 14!

This is my second release... My first release was not to good but this one is better.

This script is a Fun Script which records stats for when you slap/shoot/punch/stalk anyone.

It is really basic... No bugs as far as I know. It uses INIs so if your not prepared to have a few KBs of space taken up on your computer, this isn't the script for you :(

Anyways... This script is 100% scripted by me and it took me about 10 to 20 minutes so I do not mind if you remove the credits. The script is 90 lines long and it uses "/notice" to prevent annoying others in the channel.
